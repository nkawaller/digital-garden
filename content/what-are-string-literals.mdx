# What Are String Literals?

In C++ a _string literal_ is an array of 
[chars](/fundamental-data-types-in-cpp). This means
that it is of fixed-length, just as [arrays](/what-is-an-array)
are. But we can find an easier [type](/what-is-a-data-type)
to work with in the Standard Template Library (STL).
These _STL Strings_ are resizable, and can be imported like this:
```
#include <string>
```
