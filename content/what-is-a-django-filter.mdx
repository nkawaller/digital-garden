# What is a Django filter?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

When you're working with Django templates, you have access to these
things called _filters_. You simply add them after a variable like this:
```
{{ myVariable | lower }}
```
In the above example, if `myVariable` were set to _Hello World_, it 
would now be _hello world_.

But under the hood _filters are just [functions](/what-is-a-function)_. 
In fact, if you look at the 
[source code](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/template/defaultfilters.py) 
for the _lower_ filter, you'll see that it's just this:

```
def lower(value):
    return value.lower()
```
This is important, because if you need more advanced functionality 
in a template, all you have to do is write a python function, and
then register it as a filter.
