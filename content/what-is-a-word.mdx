# What Is A Word?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Just like a [bit](/what-are-bits) or byte, a _word_ is a unit of data. 
This fixed-size unit refers to the number of bits that a CPU can 
process in one clock cycle. If a computer has a 64 bit processor, that 
means it's designed to handle 64 bit-sized words.
