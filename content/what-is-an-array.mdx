# What Is An Array?

An `array` is a data structure that's a collection of elements
of the same [type](/what-is-a-data-type). In C++ arrays are 
of fixed-length, which can lead to the common silent error of 
out-of-bounds indexing. Because of this, it's often easier to use a 
[vector](/what-is-a-vector).
