# A Struct Is A User-Defined Collection Of Elements

A _struct_ is a user-defined [data type](/what-is-a-data-type).
It's a collection of elements of different types that are grouped 
together in one chunk of memory. They are similar to C++ 
[classes](/what-is-a-class),
but their [members](/what-are-class-members) and base classes 
are [public](/public-and-private-class-members) by default. With 
classes they're private.
