# Guidelines For Defining Classes

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

## Responsibilities
- Divide the work into different actors, each with a seperate responsibility
- Use action verbs to describe responsibilities
- Create a [class](/what-is-a-class) for each actor

## Independence
- Make sure each actor's work is independent from other actors
- Divide responsibilities so that each actor has autonomy over an aspect of the program
- If a class performs an action that requires specific data, use [member](/what-are-class-members) variables to give it that data 

## Behaviors
- Precisely define each class's behaviors, and understand the consequences of it performing these actions
- These behaviors are defined in _member functions_
- The set of a class's behaviors is called a _protocol_, and it should hold together as a cohesive unit.

> Defining classes, along with member variables and functions is the work of desiging a program. Knowing common design patterns will help with this.
