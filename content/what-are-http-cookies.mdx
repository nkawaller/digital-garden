# What Are HTTP Cookies?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

When a server responds to an HTTP request, it can send some
data, called a _cookie_ along with the response. We can use
cookies for a variety of purposes such as remembering items
in a user's shopping cart, or keeping track of user 
preferences.

Cookies are included in the HTTP response 
[headers](/what-are-http-headers).
