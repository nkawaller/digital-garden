# What Is An Interpreter?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Interpreters are computer [programs](/what-is-a-computer-program)
that translate high-level source code. In that sense they are similar to 
[compilers](/what-is-a-compiler). But the difference is 
that interpreters execute source code directly without 
translating it into machine code.
