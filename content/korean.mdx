# Basic Present Tense

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

## 아요, 어요, 여요
All Korean verbs end in 다. But we drop that ending and add
these endings to the verb stem, we create the present-tense
form of the verbs. Which ending you use depends on what the
stem ends with.

## 아요
If the verb stem ends in _ooo_, or _ah_, use 아요, pronounced:
> ahh-you
가다 becomes 가아요
The vowels run together and it's pronounced:
> kayo
and means _I go, she goes, we go, let's go_.
보다 becomes 보아요, pronounced:
> pooayo or even payo
and means _I see, he sees, she sees, they see, let's see_.

## 어요
If the verb stem ends in any other sound, such as a consonant,
use this ending, pronounced:
> ohh-you
먹다 becomes 먹어요
> mogoyou
meaning _I ean, he eats, we eat, let's eat_.

## 여요
There is one special case, the verb 하다. This verb becomes
하여요,
> ha-yo-yo
but people will more often shorten it to sound like
> hay-yo
