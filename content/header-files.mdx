# Header Files

Often we'll have many source files that need
access to the same objects. So instead of
repeatedly importing them in each source file,
we can import them once in _header files_, and 
then reuse that file in our source code. 
Header files end in `.h` and and contain our 
imports and class 
[declarations](/declaring-vs-defining). The
import syntax is different too. Normally when
we import something from the STL, it looks like:
```
#include <iostream>
```
but to import header files, we do this:
```
#include "myIncludes.h"
```

## Important
Don't do this in header files:
```
using namespace std
```

It can create [naming conflicts](/what-is-a-namespace)
in any source file that includes that header file.
