There are a few data structures that we use 
on a daily basis, and the STL is a collection
of classes with these structures already implemented 
for us. Here's a list of a few common ones:

## Stack
A container with last-in, first-out access

## Queue
A container with first-in, first-out access

## Deque 
A double-ended queue

## [Vector](/what-is-a-vector)
A resizable array. They are easier to use than 
[arrays](/what-is-an-array) because:
- We can index individual elements using `[]` syntax
- We can access elements using the `at` member function
- When we assign on vector object to another, it will 
copy the contents, [not just the pointers.](/use-a-copy-constructor-to-avoid-shallow-copies)
- We can easily resize them

## Priority Queue
A queue ordered by value

## Set
A collection of unique items

## Map
An associative array (dictionary)

## String
The _STL String_ is easier to use than a [string literal](
what-are-string-literals.md). We can use `+` to concatenate,
`+=` to append and `[]` to index. We also have access to the 
following methods:
- find
- substr
- insert
- erase
- replace
