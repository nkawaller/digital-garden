# What Is A Class?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

In C++ we can create our own data 
[types](/what-is-a-data-type) by creating
_classes_. Think of classes as a data and 
functions bound together in one entity. We call 
the class's contents [_members_](/what-are-class-members); 
_data members_ and _member functions_.

## Example Class Definition
Here's what a C++ class definition looks like:

```
class Counter {
	public:
		Counter();
		int getCount();
		void increaseBy(int x);
	private:
		int count;
	};
```

The way we define our classes is an important part
of [designing](/designing-a-cpp-program) our program;
[here](/guidelines-for-defining-classes) are some
guidelines.
