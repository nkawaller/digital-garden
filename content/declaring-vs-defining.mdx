# Declaring vs Defining

When working with variables, 
[functions](/what-is-a-function)
and [classes](/what-is-a-class), 
we can declare and/or define
them; what's the difference?

## Declare
This is when you just specify a name and type,
nothing else.

## Define
This is when you specify all the details. If
we're working with a function, this means
including the function body.
