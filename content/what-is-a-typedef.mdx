# What Is A Typedef?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Let's say we'd like to declare two variables to
use as coordinates. They'll be of 
[type](/what-is-a-data-type) `double` but we'd
like to give them a more descriptive type name.
In C++ we can do this using the `typedef` keyword.

First, we'll set up our new name:
```
typedef double Coordinate
```
And then we'll assign our variables:
```
Coordinate x, y;
```
Now we can say that `x` and `y` are of type 
`Coordinate`, which clearly indicates how we'll 
use them.
