# OOP Design Goals

In object oriented programming, software should be:

## Robust
Robust programs produce the expected outputs for all
anticipated inputs, and also handle unexpected inputs.

## Adaptable 
Things are always changing in programming and sofware needs
to be able to adapt to these changes over the years.

## Reusable
Programs should be able to be used in many different cases, 
and in future applications.
