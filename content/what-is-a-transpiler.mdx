# What Is A Transpiler?

Transpilers are similar to [compilers](/what-is-a-compiler) and
[interpreters](/what-is-an-interpreter), but they translate source
code from one language, to source code in another language. For example,
code written in JSX or TypeScript needs to be transpiled into JavaScript
before the browser can execute it.
