# Constructor And Destructor Functions

## Constructor
This [function](/what-is-a-function) 
initializes the values of a class's 
data [members](/what-are-class-members). 
It's invoked when we instantiate a 
[class](/what-is-a-class) object.

## Destructor
This member function frees up memory when 
we destroy an object. If we use the _new_
operator to [dynamically](/managing-memory-in-cpp)
create an object, we destroy it using the 
_delete_ operator.
