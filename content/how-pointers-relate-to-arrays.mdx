# How Pointers Relate To Arrays

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

An [array's](/what-is-an-array) name is a 
[pointer](/what-are-pointers) to its
first element. This is important because if we 
have two arrays, `c` and `d`,
and we want to check their equality:
```
c == d
```
we aren't checking whether the contents of both 
arrays are the same. We're checking whether their
_addresses_ are the same.
