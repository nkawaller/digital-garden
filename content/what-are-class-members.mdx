# What Are Class Members?

[Classes](/what-is-a-class) contain two kinds 
of members; _data members_ and _member functions_.
They way we define members is important in
our program's overall [design](/designing-a-cpp-program)

## Data Members
Data members are variables. They can be of any 
[type](/what-is-a-data-type), can be pointers or
references, and can even be other classes. In Java
they are called _fields_.

## Member Functions
Also called methods, these functions define the 
class's behavior by acting on its data members.

## Public vs Private Members
Both data members and member functions can be 
[public or private](/public-and-private-class-members)
