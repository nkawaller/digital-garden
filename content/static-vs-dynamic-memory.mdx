# Static vs Dynamic Memory

There are two kinds of [memory](/managing-memory-in-cpp)

## Static
We use static memory when we know how much
we need, and for any variable we know in 
advance we'll need.

## Dynamic
We use dynamic memory when we're unsure how
much we'll need. In C++ we allocate it using
_new_ and _delete_ (_malloc_ and _free_ in C).
