# What Are Bits?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Bits are the smallest unit of data in computing. They represent
the 1s and 0s. We can group them into larger data units such as
_bytes_ (8 bits) and _megabytes_ (8 million bits). If we had a 
1 megabyte file, that file would be composed of 8 million 1s and 0s.
