# Garbage Collection

In C++ we [manage](/managing-memory-in-cpp) 
memory ourselves. But Java and
Python take care of this for us though _garbage
collection_. It's easier when we don't have to 
think about it, but we also don't have any control
over when this process happens. It's a slow, 
expensive process and our program can take a 
performance hit.
