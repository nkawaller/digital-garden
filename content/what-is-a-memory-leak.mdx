# What Is A Memory Leak?

When you [allocate](/managing-memory-in-cpp) memory 
using the _new_ operator, you get a pointer to that 
block of memory. If you change the address of that 
[pointer](/what-are-pointers) without deleting
the object its pointing to, that object will be 
adrift somewhere out in memory with no way to access 
it. This is called a _memory leak_, and it will render
that memory useless until you stop the program.
