# Operator Overloading

In C++, operators are alread configured to work with built-in
[types](/what-is-a-data-type). For instance, if we have 
`int x` and `int y`, we can use
the `+` operator to give us the sum of `x` and `y`. But we can  
redefine what the `+` operator does, and use it with our [own data types](/what-is-a-class). This is called 
_operator overloading_. If we define
our own class `cube` that has `height`, `width`, and `depth`
member variables, we can overload the `+` operator to add 
the volume of two `cube` objects together.

> This reminds me of [django filters](/what-is-a-django-filter)
in that you use the + symbol, but now it calls a function you 
define.
