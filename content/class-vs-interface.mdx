# Class vs Interface

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

An interface outlines the _what_. 
[Classes](/what-is-a-class) go further 
and specify _how_ the operations are performed in 
the body of each function. A class is said to
_implement an interface_ if its functions include all
the functions [declared](/declaring-vs-defining)
in the interface.
