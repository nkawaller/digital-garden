# What is a Data Type?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

A data type (or simply _type_) is an attribute of data that 
tells the [compiler](/what-is-a-compiler) or 
[interpreter](/what-is-an-interpreter) how we intend to use 
that data. We can use types to constrian the values that a variable 
or [function](/what-is-a-function) might take, or define the 
operations that we can perform on the data.

Types exist witin a _type system_. When a programming language 
is created, this system is built into its compiler or interpreter, 
and it defines  a set of rules to ensure that the data is being 
used correctly. These rules help reduce the amount of bugs in our 
computer program, and are enforced through _type checking_. Type 
checking can happen at compile time (_static type checking_), 
at run time (_dynamic type checking_) or some combination of both.

In languages such as C++ and Python we can create our own 
data types by creating [_classes_](/what-is-a-class).
