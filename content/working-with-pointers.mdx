# Working With Pointers

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

As [mentioned](/what-are-pointers) before, pointers
are useful for passing variables between functions.
Here are a few ways that we can work with them.

## Assigning Pointers
```
int *x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
```

In the code above we are:
* allocating enough memory for 10 integers
* storing the address of that chunk of memory in a
pointer named `x`.

## Accessing The Address
Use the `&` operator to see a pointer's address

## Dereferencing
When we _dereference_ a pointer, we are accessing
the value of that variable from it's address. We do 
this using the `*` operator.
