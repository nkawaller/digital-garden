# What Are Generics

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Generics are the Java version of C++ 
[templates](/function-templates). 
We use them when we have a class that performs the 
same action regardless of type. Even though they
provide the same end result as templates, they 
work differently under the hood. With templates,
the C++ [compiler](/what-is-a-compiler) 
creates copies of code for each
type. The Java compiler doesn't make a copy with 
generics, and as a result the code runs slower.
