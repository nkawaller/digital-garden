# What Is A Namespace?

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

When we name variables and functions in a computer
program, they have to have unique names. This is 
easy in a small program but can be difficult in a 
large one. We can solve this problem by using a 
_namespace_, which is a mechanism that lets us 
define a group of related names in one place.

Here's an example of how we can declare some
variables in a global namespace:
```
namespace global_vars {
	int price;
	string duck = 'quack';
	}
```
Then we can access them by using
their _fully qualified name_:
```
global_vars::price
```
In C++ there's a system namespase called _std_ 
where we have access to objects such as `cin` and
`cout`. We can refer to them like this:

```
std::cin
std::cout
```
We have the option to add this at the top of our
file:
```
using namespace std;
```

Then we can just write `cin` and `cout`. While
easier at first, this can lead to name confilcts as
your program grows.
