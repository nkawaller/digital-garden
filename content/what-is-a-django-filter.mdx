# What is a Django filter?

When you're working with Django templates, you have access to these
mysterious little things called _filters_. You simply add them after
a variable like this:
```
{{ myVariable | lower }}
```
In the above example, if `myVariable` were set to _Hello World_, it 
would now be _hello world_.

But filters aren't magical, _they are just [functions](/what-is-a-function)_. 
In fact, if you look at the 
[source code](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/template/defaultfilters.py) 
for the _lower_ filter, you'll see that it's just this:

```
def lower(value):
    """Convert a string into all lowercase."""
    return value.lower()
```
This is important, because if you need more advanced functionality 
in a template, all you have to do is write a python function, and
then register it as a filter.
