# Public And Private Class Members

Class [members](/what-are-class-members) can
either be public or private.

## Public
Public members define the class's public
interface. These are the members we interact
with when we use the class.

## Private
These members are only accessible within the
class and we don't have access to them. This 
is a form of abstraction, and it allows us to
use the class without being bothered by the
internal workings.

## Class Friends
These are functions that can access a class's
private members
