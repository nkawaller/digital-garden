# Passing Arguments By Value

In C++, the default way 
to [pass](/passing-arguments-to-functions) arguments is by _value_.
This means a _copy_ of the variable is passed into the [function](/what-is-a-function) 
instead of the actual variable. Whatever 
the function does will not change the original argument.

In Java, all parameters are passed this way as well.
