# What is a function? 

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a
task. Ideally one single task. It takes in data, transforms it, 
and then returns it to you. 

Typically a function is made up of four parts. A _name_, that you
refer to when you want to call the function. An _argument list_;
a list of variables that you can use inside the function.
A _function body_, which is where the transformation happens. And
a _return type_; indicating the [type](/what-is-a-data-type) 
of data that this function gives you when the processing is complete.

They're useful because they make your code more modular and 
reusable.
