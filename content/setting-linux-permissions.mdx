# Setting Linux Permissions

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

Setting permissions in linux can be cumbersome, especially
with syntax such as:
```
chmod ug+rwx file.txt
```
Thankfully, there's a simpler method using the numbers from
1 to 7, and it's easy to remember if you understand the 
rationale behind how the number system is set up.

Here's 1-7 expressed in binary:
```
000 = 0
001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6
111 = 7
```
Think of the 1s and 0s as flipping a switch. 1 means 
permissions are on, 0 means off.

Now think of your three groups, _Owner_, _Group_, and _Others_, each 
having a switch for each permission (rwx).

| owner | group | other |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| 000 | 000 | 000 |
| rwx | rwx | rwx |

Flip the switch on for the permissions you want, and then convert 
that binary number to it's integer equivalent.

In the example above, no group has any permissions, and we 
express that as `000`.

If we set the permissions to `644 (110,100,100)` that would mean
the file owner has read write, and the group and others just have 
read.

`755 (111,101,101)` gives the owner read, write, execute, and everyone 
else just read and execute.

`777 (111,111,111)` gives everyone all permissions.
