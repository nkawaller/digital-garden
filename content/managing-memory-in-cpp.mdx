# Managing Memory In C++

In C++ we are responsible for managing memory ourselves.
This means when we create an object we also need to set
aside a block of memory for it. We can do this using 
the _new_ operator, which dynamically allocates the correct
number of [bits](/what-are-bits) based on the object's 
[type](/what-is-a-data-type) and gives us a 
[pointer](/what-are-pointers) to the object.

And since C++ doesn't have garbage collection, we need to 
use the _delete_ operator to deallocate the memory when
we're done using the object. Otherwise we'll end up with a
[memory leak](/what-is-a-memory-leak).
