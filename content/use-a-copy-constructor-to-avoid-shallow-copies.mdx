# Use A Copy Constructor To Avoid Shallow Copies

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

We need to be careful when copying objects to 
make sure we're copying exactly what we intend to.
Look at this example:

```
Vect a(100);
Vect b = a;
Vect c;
c = a;
```

This looks like we made three 100-element vectors,
but we just made three [pointers](/what-are-pointers)
to the same vector. Here's why. The default behavior in 
C++ is to make a _shallow copy_. This means only 
pointers are copied, not contents. We need to use a 
_copy constructor_ if we want to copy the contents.

## Remember
Whenever we create a [class](/what-is-a-class) using 
_new_, we need to:
- Define a destructor to free up memory
- Define a copy constructor which will copy
the contents of member variables and allocate 
enough memory for them.
- Define an assignment operator which deallocates
old memory, allocates new memory and copies all
member variables
