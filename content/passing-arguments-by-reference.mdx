# Passing Arguments By Reference

<TimeStamp updated="February 27, 2022, 9:20  PM ET"/>

[Passing](/passing-arguments-to-functions)
an argument by _reference_ alters the original
argument. This is the difference between passing by
reference, and passing by [value](/passing-arguments-by-value)
. In C++ we can do this by using a _reference type_, or by passing 
the _address_ (a [pointer](/what-are-pointers)).

Passing by reference is useful when you're working with
large data structures or classes, because instead of 
copying the entire structure, you can just refer to it
by its address.

### Important Note
> By default, [arrays](/how-pointers-relate-to-arrays)
> are passed by reference. This is because an array's name 
> is a pointer to its first element.

When to use reference types, when to use pointers
